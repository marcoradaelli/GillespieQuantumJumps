# GillespieQuantumJumps 

## Important!
At the moment, the repository is set as private. In the Julia documentation, it is not very clear whether it is possible to download from a private repository (see for instance [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/more-problems-trying-to-add-packages-from-private-repos/69059)). The best way is to temporarely turn the repo into a public one, follow the next steps, and then reset it to private.

## Installation instructions
Open a Julia terminal session, then press `]` to enter the `Packages` REPL. Insert the command:
```
add "https://github.com/marcoradaelli/GillespieQuantumJumps.git"
```
